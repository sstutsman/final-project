  Welcome to your final project!

  This is not your rubric. This is a document describing what the purpose of this project is and what I expect of you.

  An undeniable truth of software engineering is that you will never fully learn the platform you work with. You will also constantly be asked to do things that utilize tools you haven't learned. With this spirit, this final project is about applying everything you've learned so far AND applying several things you haven't learned.

  You will team up with zero to two other classmates and come up with a project idea and present it to me. These ideas should be of just the right size to be able to complete in a month. Being fresh with Android, I understand that estimations may be a little bit off. This is why every idea must be presented to me. I will help guide and shape projects into what I feel is the appropriate size. This is a sneaky way of telling you I will be adding something to each of your projects for you to complete. I won't be unfair, I promise. This is all in good natured learning.

  In your application you must incorporate something I haven't taught, beyond the suggestion I had for you. This may seem unclear, but we will discuss it in class.

  To reiterate, your application must contain everything I covered in class, plus something I didn't cover in class, plus something I suggest to you.
  Just so we're clear, your application contain the following
  1. At least one Activity
  2. At least one Fragment
  3. AsyncTask
  4. SharedPreferences
  5. RecyclerView

  Your final project is, of course, to be done using Git and Github. Do not fork this project to get started. Decide who's account will host the code then have them create the repository.

  I expect your code fairly well commented. Prove to me you understand what's going on and aren't just copying from StackOverflow.

Form is important too! With such GUI driven functionality, please put some thought into your design and navigation. Make use of padding.

I will not require you to use any sort of networking to access the web for content, but it sure would be cool for your app.

Finally, when it's all said and done, your team will have the option of publishing your app to the Google Play store. Totally optional. It costs $25.00 or something, but it's a once time cost. I can't force you to do it, and obviously I won't grade you on whether or not you decide to do so.
